# DCC Node Api Connector for N8N

The DCC Node REST API offers the ability to read blockchain data such as account data, token data, active leases, blocks, transactions, and other data including feature activation status and block reward voting status. It also provides transaction management functions like broadcasting signed transactions, pre-validating and checking transaction status. Additionally, it offers utilities for generating addresses from public keys, validating addresses, generating random seeds, calculating hashes, and more.

With this N8N you will be able to connect the DCC node api to your workflows, automate blockchain tasks or trigger wallet creations and more.
